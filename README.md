## QGO Desktop Assessment

### Overview

The intention for this test is to identify skills we are looking for in our
developers. You're welcome to use the internet to complete the assessment, but
we'd prefer you don't just grab large chunks of code from stack overflow.

Time: 1 Hour.

Tasks:
  1. Add the ability to complete items and show them as complete.
  2. Add the ability to filter items, using a HoC preferably.
  3. Add the ability to delete items.

Areas of interest for us:
  * Testing: Unit tests are fine, we have more levels of testing than this in
    our project, but they're fine for the assessment.
  * Style: We're interested to see how you adapt your code style to match the
    standards already used in a project.
  * HoC (Functional): We use a lot of higher order components and functional
    patterns in our main project, we're interested to see you use these.
  * Comments: It's hard to do all the things you'd like to in an assessment, if
    you feel improvements could be made in an area leave a comment:
    `// IMPROVE: Maybe do x better`.
  * Self-sufficient: Can you find the solution to problems, without getting
    stuck for too long without asking for help?
